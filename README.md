# business_card_mail_extractor

This project was created to demonstrate the use of MLKit in Flutter.

You can find the blog post where I describe the project in more detail [here](https://medium.com/flutter-community/flutter-mlkit-8039ec66b6a).

In case you want to try this out for yourself you need to create an account for Firebase and create a project there.
This is very well documented [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup).

This project uses the following Flutter packages:

* [camera](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/camera)
* [path_provider](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/path_provider)
* [firebase_ml_vision](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/firebase_ml_vision)

If you want to try the project out yourself you need to create and configure your own Firebase project.
You can find a tutorial how to do that [here](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-firebase/#5).
