# business_card_mail_extractor

This project was created to demonstrate the use of MLKit in Flutter.

You can find the blog post where I describe the project in more detail [here](https://medium.com/p/8039ec66b6a/edit).

In case you want to try this out for yourself you need to create an account for Firebase and create a project there.
This is very well documented [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup).

This project uses the following Flutter packages:

* [camera](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/camera)
* [path_provider](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/path_provider)
* [firebase_ml_vision](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/firebase_ml_vision)
